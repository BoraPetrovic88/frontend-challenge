Add the pepper and cook for 5 mins until it starts to soften.\n\nAdd the chopped tomatoes and stock, lower the heat and simmer for 20-25 mins until you have a thick ragu, then stir in the finely chopped coriander.\n\nHeat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Lay each flatbread on a baking tray. Put half the vegetable mix in the centre of each and spread it out a bit, keeping at least an inch spare all the way around as a border. Make a small well in the centre and crack an egg on top of each flatbread. Crumble over the feta and put in the oven for 12-15 mins until the egg is set and the cheese melted slightly. Scatter over the remaining coriander and serve.",
